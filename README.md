# Hey, I'm Aleksandr

Full-stack engineer in Helsinki. 15+ years building products, mostly with TypeScript, Node.js, React, and AWS.

I like taking ideas from "not sure this will work" to running in production. Most of my work sits at the intersection of new tech and actual business problems.

## What I'm working on

[arxiv-search](https://github.com/beshkenadze/arxiv-search) — semantic search across 1M+ arXiv papers, runs entirely in your browser. Zero infrastructure costs. This one got some traction.

[Kaban](https://github.com/kaban-board/kaban) — terminal Kanban board built for AI code agents. Has an MCP server so Claude Code, Cursor, etc. can manage their own task boards.

[us-legal-tools](https://github.com/beshkenadze/us-legal-tools) — TypeScript SDKs for US legal APIs (eCFR, Federal Register, CourtListener, GovInfo, DOL). Auto-generated from OpenAPI specs, monorepo with Turborepo.

[eyecite-js](https://github.com/beshkenadze/eyecite-js) — TypeScript port of Free Law Project's eyecite library for extracting legal citations from text.

## Older projects I still care about

[Caesar](https://caesar.team) — open-source zero-knowledge password manager for teams. AES-256 + RSA-4096, all encryption client-side, the server never sees plaintext. I designed the crypto architecture and built it from scratch.

[bitnami-pgvector-search](https://github.com/beshkenadze/bitnami-pgvector-search) — multi-arch Docker image combining PostgreSQL, pgvector, and pg_search. Gets auto-built and tested via GitHub Actions.

## Background

Co-founded [4xxi](https://github.com/4xxi) (product dev for US/UK clients) and Denovo (AI/ML consulting, fractional CTO). Built products across legal tech, fintech, edtech. Before that — mobile dev, Android, startups in various states of aliveness.

These days I'm especially interested in RAG pipelines, vector search, MCP servers, local-first apps, and making AI tools that actually work in production rather than just in demos.
